 
# Django Weather App

Welcome to the Django Weather App repository! This README will guide you through the procedures and mechanisms of the weather application.

## Project Overview

The Django Weather App is a web application designed to provide users with current weather information for a specified location. It utilizes the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data and displays it in a user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: The web framework used for building the backend server and handling HTTP requests.
- **OpenWeather API**: A third-party API used to retrieve weather data based on location.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used for building the frontend interface of the application.
- **Bootstrap**: Provides pre-styled components and layout utilities for designing a responsive interface.


## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/django-weather-app.git`
2. **Navigate to the project directory**: `cd django-weather-app`
3. **Install dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. **Run migrations**: `python manage.py migrate`
5. **Set up API key**: Get an API key from [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and add it to `settings.py`.
6. **Start the development server**: `python manage.py runserver`
7. **Open your browser**: Visit `http://localhost:8000` to view the application.

## Usage

- Enter the name of a city or location in the search bar.
- Press the "Get Weather" button to retrieve weather information for that location.
- The weather information including temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc., will be displayed.
